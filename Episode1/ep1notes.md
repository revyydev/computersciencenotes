**Harvard Mark I** -> 1 of the biggest electro-meca. computers.
Used by IBM in 1944 for the WWII allies.
765 000 connections, 3M connections, 800km wires.


<h3>Relays</h3>

"Brains" of those elec-meca. comps.
Electro. controlled mec	. switches

Control Wire : Determines if the circuit is **open** or **closed**

If **open**, courant flows trough the Control Wire's coil, creating an electro-magnetic field, attracts the metal arm inside the relay, closing the circuit.

then -> can be connected to other circuits ( . Hollerith tab. m. )

**Problem I ** : the relay's arm has mass -> can't close and open instantly

good **old** computer = ~ 40 switches /s -> not fast enough for difficult operations/tasks.

Ex :

Mark I's calcs. took more time if they were complex.

**Problem II** : *wear & tear*

Harvard Mark I's relay number =  ~3500

``+ relays = + chances of wear``

<h4>Off Topic : Origin of "Bugs"</h4>

1947 : **moth stuck in relay**

Grace Hopper : `"From then on, when anything went wrong, with a comp. we said it had bugs in it."`

**Alternatives**

1904 : J. Ambrose Fleming -> created thermo ionic valve -> two electrodes in bulb ( **Equivalent of a diode** ) ( called vacuum tubes )

1906 : Lee de Forest -> added 3rd electrodes ( **Kinda added a switch to it** )

<h3> End of electro-mecanic "Era" </h3>

<h3> Start of the electronic "Era" </h3>

Colossus Mk1 -> 1st big computer using vacuum tubes -> inv. by Tommy Flowers in 1943 -> helped to decrypt nazi messages
-> **First Programmable Electronic Computer**

1600 Vacuum Tubes.

ENIAC ( Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator ) -> 1946, Uni. of Pennsylvania -> J. Presper Eckert \+ John Mauchly
-> **First General Purpose Programmable Electronic Computer**
5000 additions/subscrations/s (10 digits)
Ten Years **uptime**
~ Had done MORE maths than the entire human race at that point.
Common Failures tough. ( due to vacuum tubes )

AN/FSQ-7 -> 1955 for army -> New Elec. switch needed

**1947** : Inv. of the Transistor by Bell John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley = New Era of Computing

- Switching 10k/s
- Solid State Components
- Small

IBM 608 -> 1957
->  First fully Transistor powered and commercialized com.
 
- 3000 Transistors
- ( 4500 additions ) / ( 80 multiplications/divisions ) /s

<h4> Off Topic : Origin of the Silicon Valley & Intel</h4>

Most of transistor/semi-conduct. dev. happened in Santa Clara valley ( btwn : SF & SJ, Cali )
Most used material for those materials = Silicon

= **Name of the place  ; Silicon Valley**

1. William Shockley -> Silicon Valley
2. Founds Shockley Semi-cond.
3. Shockley Semi-cond. employees -> Fairchild Semi-cond.
4. Fairchild Semi-cond. -> **INTEL**
